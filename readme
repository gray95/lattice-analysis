These are a collection of scripts for analysing meson correlators from lattice QCD simulations.

These scripts rely heavily on Peter Lepage's corrfitter and g2tools libraries.

[code]

These scripts were written with the analysis of hybrid mesons in mind.

[g-2]

these scripts are for estimating the hvp contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. The idea is fairly simple,
			1) Fit vector correlators
			2) Fourier transform
			3) Integrate over kernel
